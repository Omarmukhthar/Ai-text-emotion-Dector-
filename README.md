This project is a **web-based AI-powered text emotion detection system** that analyzes user input and identifies the emotion expressed — especially tuned for **Indian languages**. Built using **Flask**, this app uses an external AI API to classify emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, and more.
## 📌 Features

- ✅ Detects emotions from user-submitted text
- 🌍 Supports **multiple Indian languages**
- ⚡ Uses **real-time AI API** for accurate predictions
- 🖥️ Clean, responsive user interface
- 🔧 Flask-based backend logic

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user types a sentence in any supported Indian language.
2. The app sends the input to a **remote AI model API**.
3. The API returns an emotion classification (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
4. The result is shown with a styled response page.
